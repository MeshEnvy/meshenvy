## Mission Statement Discussion

The group engaged in a productive discussion about MeshEnvy's mission: **"Stand anywhere in Nevada and reach another node."** This simple yet powerful statement captures our vision of creating a resilient, statewide mesh network that ensures no one in Nevada is ever truly isolated from communications.

## Strategic Partnerships and Value Propositions

One of the meeting's key outcomes was identifying potential partner organizations and the value propositions for each:

### Emergency/Disaster Response
- **Value**: Reliable communications when traditional infrastructure fails
- **Partners**: Emergency services, disaster response teams, search and rescue

### Ranching Communities
- **Value**: Off-grid communications for remote operations
- **Partners**: Nevada ranching associations, rural communities

### Mining Operations
- **Value**: Communications in remote mining locations
- **Partners**: Mining companies, geological survey organizations

### UNR Webcam Network
- **Value**: Integration with existing infrastructure
- **Partners**: University of Nevada, Reno

## Board of Directors Composition

The group discussed the initial composition of MeshEnvy's Board of Directors, recognizing the need to balance different types of expertise:

- **Networkers**: Those with connections and relationships in the community
- **Doers**: Those with technical skills and hands-on experience

This balance ensures both strategic vision and practical execution capabilities.

## Next Steps: Node Site Identification

The meeting concluded with a concrete action item for all attendees: **By Friday, October 24th, each person will identify a potential node site and determine who needs to give permission for deployment.**

This collaborative approach to site identification leverages the group's diverse knowledge of Nevada's geography and community connections.

## Looking Forward

This meeting represents a significant step forward for MeshEnvy. The diverse group of attendees—from students to emergency responders to experienced mesh networkers—demonstrates the broad appeal and potential impact of our mission.

The combination of strategic partnership discussions and practical next steps shows that MeshEnvy is moving from vision to action. With each attendee identifying potential node sites, we're building the foundation for Nevada's first comprehensive mesh network.
