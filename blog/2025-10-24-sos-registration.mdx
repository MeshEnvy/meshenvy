We're excited to announce that MeshEnvy NCC has officially submitted our Articles of Incorporation to the Nevada Secretary of State. This marks a pivotal milestone in our journey to formalize our organization and expand our mission across Nevada.

## Making It Official

Today, MeshEnvy NCC took a major step forward by filing our Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State. This submission represents months of planning, community meetings, and strategic discussions about how best to serve Nevada's mesh networking needs.

The Articles of Incorporation establish MeshEnvy as a formal nonprofit corporation in the State of Nevada, setting the foundation for everything we're building toward.

## Our First Board of Directors

As part of the incorporation process, we've declared our founding Board of Directors:

- **Ben Allfree** - MeshEnvy NCC Founder
- **Ed Mitchell** - SAR, DRI, NSHE
- **Leslie Allfree** - Emergency/Disaster Response

This initial board brings together diverse expertise in technology, emergency response, and community organization. Together, they'll guide MeshEnvy through our next phase of growth and development.

## What This Means

Filing our Articles of Incorporation is more than just paperworkâ€”it's the formal beginning of MeshEnvy as a Nevada nonprofit corporation. Once approved by the state, we'll have the legal foundation needed to:

- Enter into formal partnerships with organizations and municipalities
- Open bank accounts and manage finances transparently
- Build organizational infrastructure that scales with our mission
- Pursue grants and funding opportunities
- Establish clear governance and accountability structures

## Next Steps: 501(c)(3) Status

Once the Nevada Secretary of State approves our incorporation, our next major milestone will be applying for federal 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status with the IRS. This designation will bring additional benefits:

- **Tax-deductible donations**: Supporters can contribute and receive tax benefits
- **Grant eligibility**: Access to federal, state, and private grants reserved for 501(c)(3) organizations
- **Enhanced credibility**: Recognition as a public charity serving Nevada communities
- **Foundation support**: Ability to apply for funding from charitable foundations

The 501(c)(3) application process is thorough, but it's a crucial step in maximizing our capacity to serve Nevada.

## Building Nevada's Mesh Network

While we navigate the administrative requirements of nonprofit formation, our core mission remains unchanged: **Stand anywhere in Nevada and reach another node.**

Every formalization step we takeâ€”from incorporation to 501(c)(3) statusâ€”is about expanding our capacity to deliver on that mission. We're building the organizational infrastructure that will help us blanket Nevada with resilient mesh network coverage.

## Thank You

None of this would be possible without our growing community of mesh networking enthusiasts, technical contributors, potential partners, and supporters. Your involvement at our October 21st general meeting, your node deployments, and your continued support are what make MeshEnvy real.

This is just the beginning. We're excited to share each step of this journey with you as we build Nevada's mesh network together.
