Before we conquer all of Nevada, let's start with something ambitious yet achievable: connecting Reno to the Black Rock Desert playa where Burning Man is held.

{/* truncate */}

## Why This Route Matters

The 120-mile journey from Reno to Gerlach to the playa is one of Nevada's most iconic routes. Every summer, tens of thousands of Burners make this pilgrimage to Black Rock City. But once you leave Reno, cell coverage becomes spotty, then non-existent.

A Meshtastic network along this corridor would provide:
- **Safety communications** for travelers in remote areas
- **Coordination** for Burning Man participants and camps
- **Emergency connectivity** in areas with zero cell service
- **Proof of concept** for Nevada's larger mesh network vision

## The Route

The primary route follows:
1. **Reno** (starting point)
2. **US-395 North** through Sparks and into Washoe Valley
3. **NV-447 North** through Wadsworth
4. **Continued NV-447** past Pyramid Lake
5. **Gerlach** (gateway town)
6. **County Road 34** to the playa (~8 miles)

Total distance: **~120 miles**

## Node Placement Strategy

With 20-mile average relay distances in Nevada's open terrain:
- **Base calculation**: 120 miles ÷ 20 miles = 6 nodes
- **Key coverage points**: Add nodes at critical locations
- **Redundancy**: Ensure no single point of failure

### Proposed Node Locations

1. **Reno Hub** – Downtown or high elevation point
2. **Spanish Springs/Pyramid Highway** – ~20 miles north
3. **Pyramid Lake Area** – ~45 miles north (tourist area, safety critical)
4. **Nixon/Wadsworth** – ~60 miles north
5. **Empire** – ~90 miles north (last services before playa)
6. **Gerlach** – ~110 miles north (gateway town)
7. **Playa Entry** – ~120 miles north
8. **Playa Center** – Black Rock City location (for event coverage)

**Total nodes needed: 8-10** depending on final placement optimization.

## The Investment

At $100 per turnkey node:
- **Minimum (8 nodes)**: $800
- **Optimal (10 nodes)**: $1,000
- **Enhanced redundancy (12 nodes)**: $1,200

For **less than $1,000**, we can create a reliable 120-mile communications corridor through one of Nevada's most remote regions.

## Burning Man Integration

This is where things get exciting. The [Burning Mesh](https://www.burningmesh.org/) community has already built an incredible Meshtastic deployment for Black Rock City, providing playa-wide communication for camps, art cars, and adventurers.

### Collaboration Opportunity

By extending our network to the playa, we can:
- **Bridge to Burning Mesh** – Connect their playa network to the outside world
- **Year-round coverage** – Provide connectivity beyond the week-long event
- **Emergency services** – Support year-round playa visitors and researchers
- **Shared infrastructure** – Collaborate on hardware, firmware, and best practices

We hope to work with our friends at **Burning Mesh** to make this connection a reality. Their expertise in playa deployments and community organization would be invaluable.

## Why This Is Our First Goal

Conquering all of Nevada is the dream, but Reno-to-Playa is the perfect starting point:

1. **Manageable scope** – 8-10 nodes vs. 300+ for statewide
2. **High impact** – Serves a heavily-traveled route with spotty coverage
3. **Community support** – Burning Man community is tech-savvy and engaged
4. **Proof of concept** – Demonstrates what's possible before scaling up
5. **Strategic expansion** – Natural corridor for extending north-south through Nevada

## Getting Started

Here's what needs to happen:

### Phase 1: Planning (Q4 2025)
- Finalize node placement locations
- Identify property owners/site hosts along route
- Connect with Burning Mesh team for coordination
- Secure initial funding/commitments

### Phase 2: Deployment (Q1-Q2 2026)
- Install first 3-4 nodes (Reno, Pyramid Lake, Empire/Gerlach)
- Test connectivity and optimize placement
- Add remaining nodes for full coverage
- Integrate with Burning Mesh infrastructure

### Phase 3: Operations (BM 2026 and beyond)
- Maintain network through Burning Man 2026
- Gather feedback and metrics
- Expand coverage based on usage patterns
- Use as template for other Nevada corridors

## Join Us

This isn't just about technology—it's about building resilient infrastructure for Nevada's communities. Whether you're a:
- **Burner** looking to improve playa communications
- **Local resident** wanting better rural connectivity
- **Tech enthusiast** excited about mesh networking
- **Property owner** along the route willing to host a node

We want to hear from you.

Together, we can connect Reno to the playa. Then we can connect all of Nevada.

**Who's ready to build?**
