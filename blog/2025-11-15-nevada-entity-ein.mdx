MeshEnvy NCC now has its official Nevada community communications credentials locked in. The Nevada Secretary of State issued our Entity ID **E52600402025-2** and Business ID **NV20253463357**, confirming that MeshEnvy NCC is formally recognized by the state. In parallel, the IRS assigned our Employer Identification Number (EIN) **41-2583340**, allowing us to stand up banking, manage donations, and keep finances transparent as we grow.

## Why It Matters

Having both the Nevada Entity ID and EIN means we can:

- Operate as a fully registered Nevada nonprofit corporation
- Enter into agreements, open accounts, and manage donations responsibly
- Move faster on infrastructure purchases and grant applications

MeshEnvy NCC is no longer just a vision—it's an official corporation with the paperwork to back our mission.

## 501(c)(3) Filed with the IRS

Our next leap is federal charitable status. We have formally filed our 501(c)(3) application with the IRS and are awaiting their determination. Once approved, supporters will be able to make tax-deductible donations, and we can pursue a broader range of grants and partnerships dedicated to public benefit communications.

## What’s Next

In the coming weeks we'll:

- Share progress updates as the IRS reviews our filing
- Continue expanding the Nevada network map with new nodes
- Prepare governance policies that align with charitable best practices

Thank you to everyone building rigs, scouting sites, and spreading the word. With our Nevada credentials in-hand and 501(c)(3) status pending, MeshEnvy NCC is better positioned than ever to deliver resilient communications anywhere in Nevada.
