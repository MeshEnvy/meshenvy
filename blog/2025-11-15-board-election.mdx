MeshEnvy NCC has elected its inaugural Board of Directors, marking a major milestone on our path to nonprofit status and statewide mesh coverage. The board blends decades of technical execution with nonprofit governance so we can scale responsibly while staying true to Nevada's mesh community.

## Why a Board Now

Forming the board formalizes the leadership that has already been guiding fundraising, equipment sourcing, and volunteer coordination. With nonprofit registration underway, we now have the accountability structure donors, partners, and public agencies expect when collaborating on communications infrastructure.

## Meet the Directors

### Ben Allfree, Founder

Ben has spent his career in software engineering, embedded systems, and networked communications. After helping hundreds of founders move from concept to launch, he's now focused on building Nevada's mesh. Ben holds a BS in Computer Science, a BA in Music from UNR, and an entrepreneurship-focused MBA from St. Francis University.

### Edward Mitchell, Director

Edward brings governance discipline and operational foresight. His role on the board is to keep the organization on a sustainable trajectory, making sure every growth step reinforces our community-first mission.

### Leslie Allfree, Director

Leslie specializes in stakeholder alignment and transparent decision-making. She keeps the board centered on the needs of our statewide partners so deployments remain rooted in real community priorities.

## Open Seats

Two director seats remain open for leaders with experience in public land stewardship, nonprofit governance, state or local policy, or grassroots outreach. If you can help connect those worlds to Nevada's mesh community, let us know at hello@meshenvy.org. We'll share a short interest form and next steps.

## What's Next

The board will oversee:

- Nonprofit filing and financial controls
- Node deployment priorities and equipment purchases
- Community partnerships with emergency response, land managers, and rural groups

Expect transparent updates as we finalize bylaws, expand the director slate, and schedule the next open meeting. Nevada's mesh network is officially under board stewardship—let's build it together.
