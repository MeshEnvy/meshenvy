We're thrilled to announce that our GoFundMe campaign is now live! This is the first step toward making Nevada-wide mesh network coverage a reality.

## Our First Goal: $3,000

We're starting with an achievable but meaningful target: **$3,000**. This initial fundraising goal isn't just about equipment—it's about unlocking the infrastructure we need to build something sustainable.

### What $3,000 Enables

This first milestone will allow us to:

1. **Form a 501(c)(3) nonprofit** - Cover filing fees, legal costs, and initial operating expenses
2. **Deploy initial nodes** - Begin building the Reno-to-Playa corridor with our first batch of solar-powered nodes
3. **Establish financial infrastructure** - Set up proper banking and accounting systems

## Why This Matters

Right now, we're limited in what we can do. Without nonprofit status, we can't:

- Accept tax-deductible donations
- Set up a Stripe account for our merchandise store
- Enable GitHub Sponsors for recurring donations
- Activate monthly recurring donations on GoFundMe
- Open a nonprofit bank account
- Apply for most grants and funding opportunities

**Your $3,000 investment unlocks all of this.**

Once we establish 501(c)(3) status, we can scale up fundraising efforts, accept recurring donations, and access grant funding that could take us from a handful of nodes to statewide coverage.

## The Vision

We're not just building a network—we're building resilient infrastructure for Nevada's communities. Imagine:

- **Burners** having reliable communication from Reno all the way to the playa
- **Rural residents** staying connected even when cell towers fail
- **Emergency responders** communicating during natural disasters
- **Travelers** having safety communication across Nevada's vast empty spaces

For **$30,000-$35,000 total**, we could cover all of Nevada with 300-350 solar-powered Meshtastic nodes. That's less than the cost of a new car—for an entire state's emergency communication backbone.

But we have to start somewhere. And that somewhere is $3,000.

## Every Dollar Counts

At this stage, every contribution makes a real difference:

- **$25** - Covers part of the nonprofit filing fees
- **$50** - Contributes toward legal document preparation
- **$100** - Funds one complete solar-powered node
- **$500** - Covers a significant portion of 501(c)(3) formation costs
- **$1,000+** - Enables both nonprofit formation and initial node deployment

No amount is too small. Whether you give $5 or $500, you're helping build something that will serve Nevada for years to come.

## What Happens Next

Here's our roadmap once we hit $3,000:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
- File for 501(c)(3) status
- Establish nonprofit bank account
- Set up accounting and transparency systems
- Deploy first 3-4 nodes on the Reno-to-Playa route

### Phase 2: Infrastructure (Months 3-4)
- Activate Stripe for merchandise sales
- Enable recurring donation options
- Launch official merch store
- Continue node deployment

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 5+)
- Apply for grants and larger funding
- Expand to other Nevada corridors
- Build partnerships with communities and organizations
- Recruit volunteers for node hosting and maintenance

## Join the Movement

This isn't just a fundraiser—it's the beginning of something bigger. We're building the foundation for a community-owned, resilient communications infrastructure that will serve all Nevadans.
